# tranche-manager

The application is responsible for managing the tranche and token objects, tranche subscription and tranche distribution based on the pledge queue.

This application is a `tranche-queue` sibling. It's main focus is on handling the tranche release / subscriptions and surrounding objects (tokens, etc...). Whereas `tranche-queue` is aimed to manage pledges and organize the queue.

The technical documentation is available in google docs: [Sweetcoin Queue Oracle](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_aAedNVC8YngK_xD8qeP4_CGeBlGS2fMexu3S7ltnYk/)
